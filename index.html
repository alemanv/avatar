    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Katara is a waterbender who was born in the Southern Water Tribe. When she was a child, she was the only person who was able to waterbend in her tribe. Her mother died in a Fire Nation raid and her father left to battle against the Fire Nation, so she was raised alongside her brother Sokka by her grandmother. When Katara and Sokka were teenagers, they discovered a person and a bison who had been frozen in an iceberg. It was actually the Avatar, Aang, and his bison, Appa, whom they discovered. Since Aang needed an airbending master, Katara and Sokka left the South Pole to go to the Northern Water Tribe. When they left the Northern Water Tribe, Katara became Aang's waterbending master, and the three continued to travel together so that Aang could master all of the bending arts and defeat Ozai, the ruler of the Fire Nation.</p>
