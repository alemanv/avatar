    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Zuko is a firebending master who was born as a prince in the Fire Nation Royal Family. He is the oldest child of Fire Lord Ozai but was banished from the Fire Nation after accidentally disrespecting his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him. For three years, he began to search for the Avatar to end his banishment and restore his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. He was initially the main enemy of Aang and his friends in his goal to capture the Avatar, but with support from his uncle General Iroh and after dealing with so much inner struggle, Zuko rejected Ozai and his model of the Fire Nation. He ended up joining Aang's group and supported them in defeating Ozai and ending the Hundred Year War.</p>
