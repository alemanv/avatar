    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Toph is an earthbending master who was born to the wealthy Beifong family. She was blind since birth, which subjected her to her parents' condescending treatment towards her. One day, she discovered badgermoles, which are blind animals that can earthbend. Seeing how badgermoles could earthbend while blind allowed her to develop her own unique style of earthbending in which she can "see" the vibrations that pass through the ground. Although she initially contested in underground tournaments, she eventually joined Aang and his friends as his earthbending teacher when she could no longer withstand her parents, becoming part of their group and their goal to defeat Ozai.</p>
    <h4>Toph's Abilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Toph can control earth and rock due to her being an earthbender</li>
      <li>Toph can manipulate metal because metal is a part of the earth that has been purified and refined, and she was the first person to ever be a metalbender</li>
      <li>Toph is able to "feel" vibrations in the earth via earthbending, allowing her to visualize where people were, their relative distance to her, their physical build, and how they would attack</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Famous Quote</h4>
    <blockquote>“I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!”</blockquote>
